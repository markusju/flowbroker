# Flowbroker

The Flowbroker is a proof-of-concept for a system architecture allowing to make RFC 5575 compliant Flow Specification Rules accessible to end users securely.
It was developed as part of my Bachelor's thesis at Saarland University of Applied Sciences (htw saar, Saarbr√ºcken, Germany) in 2016.
